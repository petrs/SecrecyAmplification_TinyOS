# What is Secrecy amplification?
The secrecy amplification protocol provides description how messages with a fresh key material should be propagated inside a target network to provide secure link key to nodes with key currently compromised by an attacker. As wireless networks running on batteries are targeted, not only protocol's success rate (number of newly secured links), but also message overhead (significantly impacting energy consumption) must be considered.
A secrecy amplification protocol can be pretty effective: a network with 50-70 % of compromised links can be turned into network with 95+ % secure links for the price of small hundreds of messages (per node) in only tens of seconds. 

This is proof of the concept. Read more at https://crocs.fi.muni.cz/public/papers/wistp2015
